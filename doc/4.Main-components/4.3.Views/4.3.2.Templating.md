#4.3.2 - Templating - View component - Nucleon JS framework

When registering a view, a template is always defined. It can be written down in the view config (in _template_ key), or be in remote file (in _templateUrl_ key), or will be the root element itself if nothing else is precised. Eitherway, Nucleon will look for references to the view execution context, instructions or expressions and will perform operations accordingly.

##Mustache markers

A lot of templating engines are using mustache markers (Twig notably). It's a simple markup using double bracelets (**{{ }}**) in which you can precise a reference to an object, a function, or an operation. It is used mostly to display values.
If you use functions, variables or objects in these markers, you have to define them in your view execution context.

###Displaying values

**Displaying a value**

```html
<div>{{ value }}</div>
```

**Displaying an object prop**

```html
<div>My name is {{ user.firstname }}.</div>
```

**Concatenate string**

```html
<div>My full name is {{ user.firstname + ' ' + user.lastname }}.</div>
```

**Using length**

```html
<!-- Count characters -->
<div>My name has {{ user.firstname.length }} letters.</div>
<!-- Count items in an array -->
<div>I have {{ user.friends.length }}</div>
```

**Use markers in attributes**

```html
<a href="/user/{{ user.id }}">Show profile</div>
```

###Using functions

**Calling a function**

```html
<div>I am {{ calculateAge(user.birthDate) }} years old.</div>
```

**Calling a object method**

```html
<div>I am {{ user.sayMyAge() }} years old.</div>
```

###Making operations

It is also possible to evaluate a mathematical expression.

```html
<div>{{ (2 + 3) * 10 / 4 }}</div>
```

In order to do that, you can use all these symbols, reproducing native javascript symbols:

| Symbol | Description                             | Example                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| +      | Make an addition, or concatenate string | `1 + 2` = 3, `"a" + "b"` = "ab"     |
| -      | Substract                               | `20 - 5` = 15                       |
| *      | Multiply                                | `13 * 5` = 45                       |
| /      | Divide                                  | `15 / 3` = 3                        |
| %      | Modulo                                  | `10 % 3` = 1                        |
| ==     | Is strictly equal to                    | `1 == 1` = true, `1 = "1"` = false  |
| !=     | Is not equal to                         | `1 != 0` = true                     |
| >      | Is greater than                         | `1 > 0` = true                      |
| >=     | Is greater or equal to                  | `1 >= 0` = true                     |
| <      | Is lower than                           | `1 < 0` = false                     |
| <=     | Is lower or equal to                    | `1 <= 0` = false                    |
| &&     | AND operator                            | `1 > 0 && 2 > 1` = true             |
| ||     | OR operator                             | `1 == 0 || 2 > 1` = true            |
| ?      | Ternary operation                       | `1 + 2 == 3 ? true : false` = false |
| !      | Is null, undefined, empty, false, ...   | `!user.firstname` = depends...      |

##Data-* attributes

Nucleon handles an exhaustive list of `data-*` attributes to perform specific treatments, like showing or hiding an element according to a condition, iterate over a collection of items, register an event listener. These attributes never use mustache markers, just a expression between quotes. When evaluated, these attributes (except _data-no-follow_ and _data-no-bind_) are removed, letting your DOM clean and its logic hidden.

**data-show**: show or hide an element depending on a condition

```html
<div data-show="user.friends.length == 0">You have no friend yet.</div>
```
Using data-show will perform a `display: none` if condition is not furfilled.

**data-if**: insert or remove an element depending on a condition

```html
<div data-if="user.friends.length == 0">You have no friend yet.</div>
```
Using data-if will insert or remove the element from the DOM according to the condition result.

**data-events**: add event listeners

In order to add a listener on an element, just respect the following structure: `data-event="eventName:eventFunction"`.

```html
<a data-events="click:doThis()">Click me</a>
```

You can also add multiple events, just seperate them with a `;`.

```html
<input type="text" data-events="focus:doThis(); keyup:doThat()" />
```

If you need the DOM event, just add `e` as an argument of the function called, it will be injected.

```html
<a data-events="click:catchThat(e)">Click me</a>
```

By the way, everything defined in the view execution context can be injected the same way.

```html
<a data-events="click:catchThat(e, user.firstname)">Click me</a>
```

**data-bind**: create a double data-binding

As from now, updating comes from the view execution context to the element refering to it. But it goes both ways. That's commonly called "double data binding". It is mostly used with form inputs. An input is bound to a context value, an user changes the input value and the context value is updated. To do that, all you have to do is to add a `data-bind` attribute, with a value matching a context property.
```html
<input type="text" data-bind="user.firstname" />
```

**data-for: iterable through a collection, an interval or an object properties**

To iterate in a template, just add a `data-for` attribute in the element that would be used at each iteration.

_Iterate through a collection_:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-for="friend in user.friends">{{ friend.firstname }}</li>
</ul>
```

_Iterate through a collection with current index_:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-for="key, friend in user.friends">{{ key }} - {{ friend.firstname }}</li>
</ul>
```

_Iterate through an interval_:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-for="i in 10">{{ i }}</li>
</ul>
```

_Iterate through an object properties names_:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-for="prop in user">{{ prop }}</li>
</ul>
```

_Iterate through an object properties names and value_:

```html
<ul>
    <li data-for="prop, value in user">{{ prop }}:{{ value }}</li>
</ul>
```

**data-no-bind**: exclude an element from binding

In some cases, you could want an element to be excluded from binding. In that case, just add a `data-no-bind` in the element.

```html
<div>
    <!-- {{ user.firstname }} will be replaced by the context value -->
    <div>{{ user.firstname }}</div>
    <!-- With data-no-bind, {{ user.lastname }} will appear as {{ user.lastname }} -->
    <div data-no-bind>{{ user.lastname }}</div>
</div>
```

**data-no-follow**: exclude request from being catched

Sometimes, you will need to let a request be perfomed naturally (to open a page in a new tab for example). The Nucleon routing system will avoid that by default if the request path and method match a registered page. In order to do that, add an `data-no-follow` attribute in the element.

```html
<a href="/my/path" target="_blank" data-no-follow>Click me</a>
```

##All-in-one example

Here is a little example showing how to build a view, defining a context, and use references to it in a template.
In this use case, we want to build a view in which we show user friends, and proposing him to add some if he has none.

```javascript
// Registering the view
app.views.add('user friends', {
    root: '#my-container',
    context: {                                                         // Define an user, having a collection of friends
        user: {
            friends: [
                { firstname: 'Joe', lastname: 'Black' },
                { firstname: 'Adam', lastname: 'White' },
            ],
        }
    },
    template: (                                                        // Building my template
        '<h1>My friends ({{ user.friends.length }})</h1>'+             // Show friends count between parenthesis
        '<ul data-if="user.friends.length > 0">'+                      // Insert friends list if at least one
            '<li data-for="friend in user.friends">'+                  // Iterate through each item in friends collection
                '{{ friend.firstname + ' ' + friend.lastname }}'+      // Showing their full name
            </li>'+
        '</ul>'+
        '<a href="/add-friend" data-show="user.friends.length == 0">'+ // Show button if no friend
            'We all need friends, add some'+
        '</a>'
    )
});

// Render the view (this way or another), because for now, it's just registered.
app.views.render('user friends');
```
