# 4.3.1 - Building - View component - Nucleon JS framework

A view is an object supervising the life of a template in the application. It turns a template into a DOM element, replaces context references by their value, evaluates expressions, bind any change of the context to operate an update, and offers methods to insert (_render_) or remove template (_revoke_) from the DOM.

## Register a view

A view can be registered two ways. First, it can be registered in a page directly, because it's not meant to be used by other components. Second, it can be registered in the views services, and can be fetched from anywhere by any components.

### Inside a page

If a view is of the use of a page only, it is convenient to shortcut its registration by declaring it at the same time than the page itself. All you have to do is to add a `view` key in the config object of the page, with all components expected regularly.

```javascript
app.pages.add('homepage', {
    route: '/',
    view: {                                   // Declare the view
        root: '#my-container',
        template: '<div>Hello world</div>',
    }
    fn: function (request) {
        this.renderView();                    // Render the internal view
    }
});
```

As you can see, in this case, rendering the view needs to call a page method, `renderView()`.

### Within the views service

If a page is meant to be reused by multiple components, or if it's big and better be separated from the page, it can be registered through the app views service. It's a simple adder/getter as the models service. It has an `add(name, config)` and `get(name)` methods.

Concerning the add method, it takes two mandatory arguments:

| Name    | Type.  | Description                   |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| name    | string | defines the name of the view  |
| config  | object | defines the view config       |

Let's use an example.

```javascript
app.views.add('homepage', {   // Registering the view, returns a view instance
    root: '#my-container',
    template: '<div>Hello world</div>',
});

app.views.get('homepage');    // Also returns a view instance
```

The config object can take these keys:

| Name        | Type.  | Mandatory | Description                                                             |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| root        | string | yes       | css selector matching the container where template will be included in, |
|             |        |           | or being itself the element to bind                                     |
| template    | string | no        | html code of the template                                               |
| templateUrl | string | no        | path to the template                                                    |
| context     | object | no        | object defining variables and methods that can be used in the template  |

## Rendering and revoking a view

To include a template, a view must be rendered, and to remove it, the view must be revoked.
Each view instance has a `render()` and a `revoke()` methods for that.

```javascript
var view = app.views.add('homepage', {...});
view.render();
view.revoke();
```

Other components have methods to render a view. First, when declaring an internal view in a page, we can use inside the page the `renderView()` method. It is the only way to render it. Second, the views service has a `render(name)` method.

```javascript
var view = app.views.add('homepage', {...}); // Registering a view in app views service
app.views.render('homepage');                // Rendering it by calling app views service

app.pages.add('homepage', {
    view: {                                  // Registering a view inside a page
        //...
    },
    route: '/',
    fn: function () {
        this.renderView();                   // Rendering it by calling page "renderView()" method
    }
});
```

**NB: auto-revocation system**

When using these methods, the current view in revoked before rendering the new view.
If the view is not supposed to replace another, you can precise it, by adding `true` (for _detached_) in each methods above. For example:

```javascript
page.renderView(true);
app.view.render('homepage', true);
```
