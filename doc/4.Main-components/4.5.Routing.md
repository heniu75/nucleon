#4.5 - Routing - Nucleon JS framework

##Generating urls

Nucleon comes with a powerful routing system. As seen in 4.4.Pages, each page defines its own route, and from that we are now able to generate dynamic urls with a name, and potentially values if route expects url components.
For that we will call the `app.router.generateUrl(name, params, withHost)` method.

###Simple url generation

If a route does not expects components, it's pretty simple.

```javascript
app.pages.add('Testing routing', {                     // Adding a page with the name "Testing routing"
    route: '/testing-routing',                         // Matching the route path '/testing-routing'
    fn: function() {}
});
app.router.generateUrl('Testing routing');             // Generate relative path, '/testing-routing'
app.router.generateUrl('Testing routing', null, true); // Generate absolute url, with the host
```

###Url generation with components

If a route expects components, we must give it an object containing values matching these components.

```javascript
app.pages.add('Testing with components', {                       // Adding a page with the name "Testing routing"
    route: {
        path: '/testing/{toReplace}',                            // Having a route path expecting a component "toReplace"
        params: {
            toReplace: 'word',                                   // Which is a word
        }
    },
    fn: function() {}
});
var params = { something: 'components' };
app.router.generateUrl('Testing with components', params);       // Generate relative path, '/testing/components'
app.router.generateUrl('Testing with components', params, true); // Generate absolute url, with the host
```

NB: Any other elements in params, which would not match the components in the path, would be added as a query parameter.

###Routes having proper name

As seen in 4.4.Pages, routes can have their own name. If you do, you must use it to generate urls.

```javascript
app.pages.add('Testing routing', {
    route: {
        path: '/testing-routing',
        name: 'test_routing',            // Override the route name
    },
    fn: function() {}
});
app.router.generateUrl('test_routing'); // Use it to generate url.
```

###Generating urls in templates

Urls can be generated in views templates. For that, a public function `generateUrl(name, params, withHost)` is callable from any template.

```html
<!-- Let's assume that we have a page for showing an user profile, expecting an id as component -->
<a href="{{ generateUrl('user_profile', { "user_id": user.id }) }}">User profile</a>
```

##Redirecting

The second part of the routing is the ability to redirect a request to another url. This can be done with the `app.redirect(url, storeInHistory)` method.

```javascript
app.redirect('/'); // Will redirect the user to the path "/"
```

This can be used with the url generation.

```javascript
app.pages.add('Testing routing', {
    route: '/testing-routing',
    fn: function() {}
});
app.redirect(app.router.generateUrl('Testing routing')); // Will redirect to "/testing-routing"
```

If a page is found for the given url, the redirection will run it, update browser url and history. If not, it will be a classical http redirection.

**Storing redirection in browser history**

You may have noticed that `app.redirect` can take a second argument `storeInHistory`. This argument defines if the redirection must be added to the browser history. By default, its value is true, so it will be stored, and the browser url will be updated. But you could totally change it by giving false as a second argument, and run a page without updating the url.

```javascript
app.redirect('/hidden-treatment', false); // Will redirect to the path '/hidden-treatment' without updating url
```
