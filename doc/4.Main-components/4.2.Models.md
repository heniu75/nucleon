# 4.1 - Models - Nucleon JS framework

As explained in general concept, a model is an object used by views and any other components which would need it. Most of the time, it represents something, like an user, or a data page structure. When used in a view, it triggers an event each time one of its properties comes to change, and the view handles it to update its template accordingly. It is then just an observable object.

## Create a model

There are two ways for creating a model, directly inside a view, making it accessible only to the view, or by passing by the app models service, letting it be accessible to any script.

### Inside a view

A view may need to have an **execution context** to render its template. This context will define a data structure, that could be used inside a template, in mustache markers for example. When a context is defined, a model is automatically created. This could be done this way:

```javascript
var testView = app.views.add('test', {
    root: '#my-container',
    template: ( // Template makes references to properties
        '<div>{{ user.firstname + " " + user.lastname }}</div>'
    ),
    context: {  // Execution context is defined here, this will be turned into a model
        user: {
            firstname: 'Kévin',
            lastname: 'Marcachi'
        }
    }
});
testView.render();                                // After rendering the view
testView.getContext().user.firstname = 'Brandon'; // You can dynamically change the view context
                                                  // Which leads to a template update
```

### Within the models service

The models service is a adder/getter service in Nucleon for registering or fetching models. It has two methods: `get(name)`, and `add(name, config)`. Concerning the add method, it takes two mandatory arguments:

| Name    | Type.  | Description                   |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| name    | string | defines the name of the model |
| config  | object | defines the model structure   |

NB: The add method will throw an error if a model name is already in use.

```javascript
var userModel = app.models.add('user', { // Register the model globally, save it in a var
    firstname: 'Kévin',
    lastname: 'Marcachi'
});

var testView = app.views.add('test', {
    ...
    context: {
        user: userModel                  // Use it in a view context
    }
});

userModel.firstname = 'Brandon';         // Will update the template
```

## Fetching a model

As said above, the models service has a `get(name)` method, allowing to fetch a model from anywhere. This is particularly useful if plural views need to use a same model. To continue on the previous example, the user model could be fetched like this:

```
var userModel = app.models.get('user'); // Returns the model also
```

NB: The get method will throw an error if a model could not be found.
