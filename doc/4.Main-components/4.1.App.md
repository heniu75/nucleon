# 4.1 - The App - Nucleon JS framework

Nucleon framework is composed by a global object containing all components, the app.
It must be loaded before any other script using it.

## Include the app

### Old fashion way
You can add it with a script tag
```html
<!-- Unminified version -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/nucleon/app.js"></script>
<!-- Minified version -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/nucleon/app.min.js"></script>
```

### New way
Or you can require it in your code, if you are using a compiling solution as webpack.
```javascript
var app = require('nucleon-js');
```

Once loaded, the application can be called by the global object `app`.

## Methods and services

The app is composed by methods and services needed to create your application.
