#5.3 - Browser memory - Nucleon JS framework

The app has a manager for making AJAX requests, callable at `app.http`. It allows to perform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls.

##GET requests

You can make GET request by using `app.http.get(url, data, config)` method. Request is asynchronous by default, and you can use pipes for handling all situations.

```javascript
app.http
    .get('google.com')
    .success(function (response, code) {
        // Handle success
    })
    .error(function (response, code) {
        // Handle error
    })
    .always(function () {
        // In any case
    })
;
```

If you need to pass parameters, just give an object as second argument containing them. They will be added as query parameters.

```javascript
app.http
    .get('google.com', { search: 'My keywords'}) // Will call "google.com?search=My keywords"
    // ...
;
```

If you need to modify the request configuration, add an object as third argument. All following elements are configurable.

| Name     | Type     | Description                                      | Default |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| async    | boolean  | Asynchronous call                                | true    |
| cache    | boolean  | Store response in cache (GET calls only)         | false   |
| cors     | boolean  | Cross origin call                                | true    |
| dataType | string   | Format for data sent, "JSON" can be provided     | null    |
| format   | string   | Expected response format, "JSON" can be provided | null    |
| headers  | object   | Headers to add                                   | null    |
| progress | function | On progress callback                             | null    |
| success  | function | On success callback (to use if synchronous call) | null    |
| error    | function | On error callback (to use if synchronous call)   | null    |
| timeout  | function | On timeout callback                              | null    |
| always   | function | On complete callback. Called in any case         | null    |

Here is an example of a synchronous request to illustrate.

```javascript
var data = null;
app.http
    .get('google.com', null, {
        async: false,
        success: function (response, code) {
            data = response;
        },
        error: function (response, code) {},
        always: function () {}
    })
;
```

At some point, you could need to abort the request. Wrap request in a variable, and call `abort()` method.

```javascript
var req = app.http
    .get('google.com')
    // ...
;
req.abort();
```

##POST requests

You can make POST request by calling `app.http.post(url, data, config)` method. Behaviour is strictly identical to the GET request, except that object given as `data` argument will be send in the request body, and not added to the url as query parameters.

```javascript
app.http
    .post('my-project.local/login', {
        username: 'kevin',
        password: '*******'
    })
    // ...
;
```

**Communicate with apis**

This type of call add data as url encoded values in request body. It kind classical. But nowadays, when often communicate with apis, and send them data as json, and not url encoded values. This could be done this way.

```javascript
app.http
    .post(
        'my-project.local/articles',                   // Url
        {                                              // Data to send
            title: 'My super article',
            content: 'Content of my super article',
        },
        {                                              // Special config for communicate with a REST api using json
            format: 'JSON',                            // Turn response into json
            dataType: 'JSON',                          // Send data as json
            headers: {                                 // Add headers
                'Authorization': 'Bearer ***********', // Token, because reques is authenticated
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',    // Set the content type to precise that we communicate with json
            }
        }
    )
    // ...
;
```

##PUT requests

PUT request can be made with `app.http.put(url, data, config)` method. It is identical to POST request, except that http verb used is PUT and not POST.

##DELETE requests

DELETE request can be done by using `app.http.delete(url, data, config)`. It is similar to a GET request. Notably, object given as `data` will be used to construct query params.

```javascript
app.http
    .delete('my-project.local/articles/1', null, {
        // Handle here all configuration needed, like headers for authentication, and so on
    })
    // ...
;
```
