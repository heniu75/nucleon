    - dist:     Containing the pre-compiled nucleon app (app.js and app.min).
    - doc:      Containing the documentation of the project
    - examples: Containing examples of code
    - src:      Containing the main file building Nucleon (main.js) and all the components
    - test      Containing all the unit tests

## Include it in your project

### Old fashion way
You can add it with a script tag
```html
<!-- Unminified version -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/nucleon/app.js"></script>
<!-- Minified version -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/nucleon/app.min.js"></script>
```

### New way
Or you can require it in your code, if you are using a compiling solution as webpack
```javascript
var app = require('nucleon-js');
```
